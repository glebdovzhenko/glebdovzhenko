# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I write scientific software.

* I am a researcher with a PhD in Physics, working in the field of x-ray & neutron radiation diffraction. 
* I worked at [Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon](https://hereon.de/) for a while, did my PhD and a short postdoc.
* Now we're building **our own synchrotron in Novosibirsk**, Russia. It is called Â«SKIFÂ» (transliterated from a Russian abbreviation for Siberian Ring Photon Source), and the best source of news for it is [our telegram channel](https://t.me/srfskif) (Russian language only, sorry).

## Featured projects
### My baby from the times at Hereon: [P61AToolkit](https://github.com/hereon-GEMS/P61AToolkit)
This is a piece of user software that enables the energy-dispersive diffraction data analysis at [P61A beamlne at PETRA III](https://photon-science.desy.de/facilities/petra_iii/beamlines/p61_high_energy_wiggler_beamline_lvp/p61a_white_beam_engineering_materials_science_hereon/index_eng.html).
We have a website with its [main features](https://hereon-gems.github.io/P61AToolkit/introduction.html) and some [tutorials with screenshots](https://hereon-gems.github.io/P61AToolkit/viewer/tut_tth_cal.html).

### My old, old set of lab excercises for [neutron scattering students at SPbSU](https://nsp.phys.spbu.ru/en/): [NeutronLab](https://github.com/glebdovzhenko/NeutronLab)
A set of UIs emulating the basic functions of several beamlines at IR-8. Allows the students to do introduction-level labwork without the hassle of actually going to a nuclear reactor.

### My fresh, fresh course on data analysis in Python for 1st year bachelors at [NSTU](https://ciu.nstu.ru/kaf/mm): [pycourse01](https://github.com/glebdovzhenko/pycourse01)
If you are reading this during spring semester of 2024, it is so fresh, that it's not even finished yet ðŸ™„. Updates every week or so!

Student notes & problem sets are [here](https://github.com/glebdovzhenko/pycourse01/tree/main/assignments). The rest is a semi-developed attempt at automated grading, which I started and then immediately found too cruel towards the students. This will probably evolve a lot.

### And finally, my synchrotron beamline modeling repo: [skif-xrt](https://github.com/glebdovzhenko/skif-xrt)
I aim to have a model for every SKIF beamline there at some point. However, right now I am only involved with 1-5 and 2-1 (NSTU_SCW in the repo), so they are the only ones to be trusted.

----

Also (if you are into that sort of thing ðŸ¤“) I have a [tmux & neovim config](https://github.com/glebdovzhenko/dotfiles) that I use every day on my laptop and several linux VMs.
